# release-gen
GitHub Action to generate next release version and release notes based on commit messages.
Intended to be used only as part of GH action `agilecustoms/publish`

## relation to semantic-release
This action is a wrapper for [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Motivation: `semantic-release`, when used as CLI, does not provide `next_version` and `notes` as clear outputs, but rather print everything.
The only way to get these values is to call `semantic-release` as Node.js module

## Usage
Code below is not a real _usage_, but rather a block of code from `agilecustoms/publish` action.
Parameters are not documented: part of them are inputs in `publish` action, the other part is generated by `publish` action.
```yaml
- name: Release generation
  id: release_gen
  if: inputs.dev-release == 'false'
  uses: agilecustoms/release-gen@main
  with:
    changelog-file: ${{ inputs.changelog-file }}
    changelog-title: ${{ inputs.changelog-title }}
    tag-format: ${{ inputs.tag-format }}
```
