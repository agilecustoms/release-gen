# release-gen

GitHub Action to generate a **next release version** and **release notes** based on commit messages.
Intended to be used only as part of GH action [agilecustoms/release](https://github.com/agilecustoms/release)

## relation to semantic-release

This action is a wrapper for [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Motivation: `semantic-release`, when used as CLI, does not provide `next_version` and `notes` as clear outputs, just print them.
The only way to get these values is to call `semantic-release` as Node.js module

## Usage

The code below is not a real _usage_, but rather a block of code from `agilecustoms/release` action.
Parameters are not documented: part of them are pass through from `release` action, the other part is generated by `release` action
```yaml
- name: Release generation
  id: release_gen
  if: inputs.dev-release == 'false'
  uses: agilecustoms/release-gen@main
  with:
    changelog_file: ${{ inputs.changelog-file }}
    changelog_title: ${{ inputs.changelog-title }}
    npm_extra_deps: ${{ inputs.npm-extra-deps }}
    release_branches: ${{ inputs.release-branches }}
    release_plugins: ${{ inputs.release-plugins }}
    tag_format: ${{ inputs.tag-format }}
```

## Misc

Majority of GH actions use kebab-case for inputs, but this action uses snake_case. It is done for integration testing purposes
